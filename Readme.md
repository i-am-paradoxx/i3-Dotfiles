# issues

curently the script only works for `debian` Based OS only
it will be available or `arch` based OS soon

if you are using VM do not install `picom` because it will cause some graphics issue i.e lag,unresponsiveness,etc
if you are installing this script on a bare machine it will work perfectly
if you wish to try the dot files without picom use this command

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i-am-paradoxx/i3-Dotfiles/main/install_without_picom.sh | bash

```
